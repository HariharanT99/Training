	MANAGING STATE IN ANGULAR APPLICATION

Six types of states

- Sever state
- Persistent state
- The URL and router state
- Client State
- Transient client state
- Local UI state

SERVER STATE,

stored on server, provided via REST endpoint. 

PERSISTENT STATE                                                            //Doubt

subset of server state stored on client memory

can treat the persistent state as a cache of the server state

CLIENT STATE

Client state is not stored on the server--- (Ex: Filter)

TRANSIENT CLIENT STATE

Transient client state -------------(Ex:Youtube video) 
	

<----------------------Recommendation: When identifying the type of state, ask yourself the following questions: Can it be shared? What is its lifetime.------------->

Persistent & Server ---- Client & URL stores the same info..	We have to schronize them......One of the most important decision, wthile designing the state management...
